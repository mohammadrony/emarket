# Vue.js and Node.js Web Application with MySQL Database

## Project Overview

This is an e-commerce web application with a frontend, backend, and database. It uses Vue.js framework for frontend, Express.js framework for the backend with Node.js, and MySQL database. Here is the instructions for [project setup](#project-setup).

### Project UI Overview

#### For Users without Logging In

This e-commerce system features **three levels of category system** (category, sub-category, sub-sub-category) and some products with necessary information in each category. You can also **search for products** with keywords and price ranges in a category. You can see other **customer reviews** for those products as well. Then, you can **add products to your cart and checkout**. To checkout with your product in your cart, you need to provide shipping information and some contact information. Then, you have to pay the bill with your card using the **Stripe checkout method**, and your order will be placed. A link will be sent to your email to **monitor your order status** with the contact information and the products you are buying. On the home screen, there is a **promotion of products** available for new and top selling products.

#### For Users Logging In

Including features from above. By logging in to the system or signing up, you can use **wishlist to save products** for you and find them later. You can also **add a review and rating to any product**. You need to **verify your email** to create your account. If you forget your password, you can **reset password by sending a verification mail**. This web app also includes a **user profile with your activities**.

#### For Admin Users

Including features from above. As an admin, you have a custom way to **create or delete a product** from any category. You can **create, edit, or delete any category** from the list. You can also **delete a users review** of any product. You can use the **admin panel**, with the list of all registered users in your system, and you can **change user role** in the application. You can also access the **order list** with the user's contact information, shipping address, and product information.

### Programming Overview

#### Frontend Description

This project is implemented in Vue.js(version 2). The web app features **state management with multiple modules** in the store directory. For the frontend, there's an authentication process with a **reset password** feature that includes email automation. By using **Stripe's payment method**, the web app can process different kinds of cards and currencies supported by Stripe. From the routing pages, you'll find detailed code about how to **restrict someone visiting a route** and show a default page for an **unauthenticated request or any wrong URL** entered. There are also other features, including real-time updates without reloading the page, and more.

#### Backend Description

**RESTful APIs** and authentication management are the two important parts of the backend. The **session middleware and JWT authentication** helped get data from the database securely. Most of the **email automation** is done in the backend. The payment session is generated, and **Sequelize ORM** can be used to work with different types of databases. This project worked with the MySQL database here. **Media files are saved** and public URLs generated. I hope you find this project useful. If you still have any questions, create an issue or ask me anyway.

## Project Setup

### Cloning the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammadrony/emarket.git
```

### Configuring MySQL server

Install MySQL package

```bash
sudo apt install -y mysql-server
```

Setup root user password

```bash
sudo mysql
> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '12345678';
```

You can follow [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-22-04) to configure the MySQL server in Ubuntu.

Create a new MySQL database

```bash
mysql -u root -p
> CREATE DATABASE emarket;
> exit
```

### Setting up environment variables

#### Stripe payment Integration

1. Rename the `.env.template` file in the `server` directory to `.env`.

2. Find your Stripe secret key for the `server/.env` file on your [Stripe account dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys).

   ```env
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<stripe_secret_key>
   ```

3. Update the Stripe publishable key in `shop/src/components/Checkout/BuyItem.vue` from your Stripe account.

   ```env
   const stripeInit = loadStripe(<stripe_publishable_key>);
   ```

#### Email automation

Sending emails from a gmail account

1. Enable [2-step verification](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification) for your Google account.

2. Generate an [app password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) (16-digit password) for your account.

3. Use this app password in the `.env` file in the `server` directory in the following format:

   ```env
   EMARKET_EMAIL=<email_address>
   EMARKET_PASSWORD=<app_password>
   ```

For more detailed information on generating app passwords, refer to this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45478293/username-and-password-not-accepted-when-using-nodemailer) and these [steps to generate app passwords](https://www.getmailbird.com/gmail-app-password/) in Google account.

*If you use some other mail provider to send email, you will need to update the transporter configuration in `server/src/controllers/` files.*

### BootstrapVue package recommendation

To ensure that BootstrapVue runs properly without any component issues, it is recommended to use the `vue@2.6.12` and `bootstrap@4.6.1` versions of the packages mentioned by [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs).

### Re-check database configuration

Please make sure to check and match the database configuration for user, password, and database information in `server/src/config/config.js` file.

### Installing server dependencies

Install server dependencies from `server` directory

```bash
cd server && npm install
```

### Installing shop dependencies

Install shop dependencies from `shop` directory

```bash
cd shop && npm install
```

### Upload some data for the website

Populate the database with some dummy data

```bash
cd server && npm run seed
```

### Start backend server

```bash
cd server && npm start
```

### Start frontend application

```bash
cd shop && npm run serve
```

### Browse the application

Your application should be running on <http://localhost:8080> and your private network.
